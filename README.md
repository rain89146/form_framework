# form_framework
light weight form framework

This is the file that get me fired from Great Las Vegas Realtors, because some moron said this shit is too complicated to implement. Heck, i did this as simple as it could be and moron still complains about it. This little framework i wrote is just doing the basic form handling, that currently only hanles 3 element, input, select and textarea. 

I'm the only Chinese developer they hired, and just because i have some accent and they isolated me, left me alone, that is racist!
